# Content-Based-Recommended-System

This is a content-based recommendation system that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history. The system uses a combination of techniques, including:

- **Text preprocessing:** converting text data into a numerical representation using CountVectorizer.
- **Keyword extraction:** extracting keywords from movie plots using Rake from nltk toolkit.
- **Cosine similarity:** calculating the similarity between movie vectors using cosine similarity.

## Tools:

**Natural language processing:** using CountVectorizer and Rake to process text data.
**Machine learning:** using cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movie vectors.
**Data preprocessing:** cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
**Programming:** using Python to implement the recommendation system.
